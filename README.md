# Express.js: Note Taker

## Description:

This application was created with the purpose of broadening my skills with express.js. 

This application is able to save and delete notes depending on the users' need.

As I worked on this application, I was able to familiarize myself with heroku as a whole and the importance of connecting front end and back end code in applcations.

## User Story:

AS A small business owner

I WANT to be able to write and save notes

SO THAT I can organize my thoughts and keep track of tasks I need to complete

## Acceptance criteria:

GIVEN a note-taking application

WHEN I open the Note Taker

THEN I am presented with a landing page with a link to a notes page

WHEN I click on the link to the notes page

THEN I am presented with a page with existing notes listed in the left-hand column, plus empty fields to enter a new note title and the note’s text in the right-hand column

WHEN I enter a new note title and the note’s text

THEN a "Save Note" button and a "Clear Form" button appear in the navigation at the top of the page

WHEN I click on the Save button

THEN the new note I have entered is saved and appears in the left-hand column with the other existing notes and the buttons in the navigation disappear

WHEN I click on an existing note in the list in the left-hand column

THEN that note appears in the right-hand column and a "New Note" button appears in the navigation

WHEN I click on the "New Note" button in the navigation at the top of the page

THEN I am presented with empty fields to enter a new note title and the note’s text in the right-hand column and the button disappears
